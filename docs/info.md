## How it works

A simple digital alarm clock in 24-hour format.

Upon reset, press "hour_inc" and "min_inc" to increment the hours/minutes.

Press and hold "alarm_set" to see the current alarm. Press "hour_inc"/"min_inc" while holding "alarm_set" to set the alarm time. Press "alarm_on_off" to toggle whether alarm is on or off (indicated by decimal point on far right display).

Press "brightness" to toggle display brightness.
